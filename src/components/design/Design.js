            Lifeâ€™s most beautiful phase started in 2019 when I became a mum to
            my lil baby boy. I took a short break from the Aviation Industry to
            settle down in the new shoes of motherhood. Ever since, I have been
            considering different career options that would compliment my
            personal life and give it a good balance.
          </div>
          <div className="app-design-text">
            My passion towards art and my problem solving skills that I have
            acquired from Aviation, guided me towards a career in UX Design. I
            aspire to learn and grow in the Industry, creating effective and
            meaningful solutions through design.
